# Implementing-an-end-to-end-object-detection-and-lane-tracking-system-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
### This project is aimed to develop a model that can detect objects in a real time video given to it as input using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Single Shot Detector (SSD) algorithm as well as detect the lanes in front of the autonomous vehicle using Cannyâ€™s edge detection and Hough algorithm.
### This model would be a similar model that is used in an autonomous vehicle for detecting objects around its surrounding and the lane markings used by the vehicle to move forward in a particular lane.
